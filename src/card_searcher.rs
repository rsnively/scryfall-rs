//! This module provides an abstraction over the search parameters provided by
//! `scryfall`. For a complete documentation, refer to the
//! [official site](https://scryfall.com/docs/syntax).
//!
//! The main struct of this module is the [`SearchBuilder`], this represents
//! a search compatible with `scryfall` search route.
//!
//! All types whose name ends in `Param` are parameters that can be passed to
//! the builder.
//!
//! [`SortMethod`], [`SortDirection`] and [`UniqueStrategy`] are options that
//! can be set on the builder.
//!
//!
//! Finally the [`Search`] trait, defines what is a valid search for `scryfall`
//! it's implemented for `String` in case it's easier for the user to directly
//! use a text representation.

/// - [`including_extras`]: Whether to include extras. (default: false)
/// - [`including_multilingual`]: Whether to include multilingual cards. (default: false)
